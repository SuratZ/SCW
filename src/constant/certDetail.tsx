        GHPs (Good Hygiene Practices) and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical
        Control Points) are fundamental food safety systems that ensure food is
        produced, handled, and stored under hygienic and controlled conditions
        to prevent contamination and protect consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        GHPs provide the foundation for hygiene and sanitation across all food
        operations, while HACCP builds on this foundation by identifying,
        evaluating, and controlling specific hazards that can affect food
        safety.
      </p>
